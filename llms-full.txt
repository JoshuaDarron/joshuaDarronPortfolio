# Joshua Darron Phillips — Full Profile

> Developer Relations Engineer focused on AI, data, and privacy.

## About

Joshua Darron Phillips is a Developer Relations Engineer and software builder based in California. He specializes in AI products, developer tools, data systems, and privacy-aware engineering. He comes from a full-stack engineering background with a focus on backend systems, data-intensive applications, and solving hard problems that live just beneath the surface.

He has spent his career working on platforms that move, protect, and make sense of large volumes of data — across industries like healthcare and enterprise data intelligence. He is especially interested in privacy-aware and local-first AI systems, and in tools that give users ownership over their data rather than treating it as a resource to extract.
